- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninR-137
- 👀 I’m interested in cheese burgers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that is interesting, mostly android development because I have a very strong backround in Java, but most Object Oriented Programming languages I can grasp pretty easily at this point.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.
